##Project Description
This is a group project on COVID 19 data analysis using Spark DataFrame and RDD. Each member has worked on 2 queries. I picked 10 best and 10 worst States of the US 
based on the ratio of death due to Covid and population. Also, I have showed the rate of Covid deaths against total number ofn deaths per state. The output data has
been exported as CSV files to use for visualization.
